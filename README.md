# Week-1-Activity
 Week 1 Activity

To fork and clone this repository, please follow these steps:

1). Click on the link that takes you to my personal GitHub account. 

2). You should be on the Week-1-Activity repository.

3). From here, in the top right corner of the screen you should see a "Fork" button. Click it.

4). It should tell you it is forking the repository into your personal GitHub account.

5). When the screen loads, you should see "yourusername/Week-1-Activity" in the top left corner. You are in the right place! You have successfully forked this repository into your account. (Basically copied and pasted it to make it your own).

6). You should see a green button that says "Code". Click that and then click "Open with GitHub Desktop". There should be another pop up that confirms you want to open GitHub Desktop. Just hit "Open GitHub Desktop" again.

7). From here your computer should have opened your GitHub Desktop application. You should see another pop up that says "Clone a Repository". You are in the right place!

8). Leave the "Repository URL" alone. The "Local Path" is where you want this repository to be located on your local drive (in your Finder). This needs to be an empty folder. If you have trouble with this step, try going back to the online version of GitHub and hit the "Code" button again. Go through the steps again. (More than likely the reason it did not work was because the folder you chose was not EMPTY. If you need to go to your finder and create a new folder to place this repository in - do it! If you need additional help, please reach out to me)

9). If you successfully forked and cloned this repository, you should see another pop up that says "How are you planning to use this fork?" - Please choose "For my own purposes" and click "Continue"

10). Now, you should see "Current Repository Week-1-Activity" in the top left corner of your GitHub Desktop application. 

11). Click "Open in Visual Studio Code" in the middle of your screen. 

12). Explore the different files. The index.html file is the only file that should have any changes to it. 

13). In the index.html file, right click and choose "Open in Default Browser"

14). You should see the finished website - BUT it contains my information! I want to learn about YOU!

15). Go back to the index.html file in Visual Studio Code and replace the information about me and change it to information about yourself. You can then right click and choose "Open in Browser" again and see your changes. 

16). After you have made your changes, go back to the GitHub Desktop application and you should see all of your changes there. In order to push to Github for your final version of this website, in the bottom left of your screen there should be a button that says "Commit to main" - click this! This will commit your changes to the main branch of your repository.

17). Another button should pop up that says "Push origin" - click this! This will push your main branch to Github. 

18). From here, you can go to your Github account online and see your newly updated repository. If you want to create a link to this website, click into the repository on your account. Right above the green "Code" button, there should be a "Settings" tab. Scroll down until you see the "GitHub Pages" heading and click the link. ("Check it out here!")

19). Under source, select the "main" branch and "/(root" and click "Save"

20). A link should see a blue pop up that says "Your site is ready to be published at "https://....." Click this link! If it does not work, wait a few minutes and refresh your page until the box around this link is green. If this does not work, at the end of the URL try adding "/index.html". If it still does not work, please reach out to me or come to office hours. 

Congratulations! You have successfully forked and cloned your own repository on GitHub and created your own webpage.
